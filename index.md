Net Neutrality

Net neutrality is the concept that internet service providers (ISPs) should provide access to all content on the internet regardless of the source, without favoring or blocking particular sources, products, or websites.

## History

The first form of the internet was developed to allow the government to share information. Many different networks were around, but most did not share a common way to communicate with each other. January 1, 1983 is commonly considered the birthday of the internet, as on that day, a new communications protocol, known as Transfer Control Protocal/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP), was implemented by various government-controlled networks. It would take twenty years before the term "net neutrality" was coined, and another two before rules were implemented by the FCC prohibiting providers from blocking legal content or preventing certain devices from connecting to their network.

In 2008, just three years later, a federal court found that the FCC failed to provide legal reasons supporting its authority to enforce those rules. Thus began a period of government agencies regulating the internet, and having courts find that they did not have legal reasons to enforce those rules. After that defeat, the FCC passed a more detailed net neutrality order. However, in 2014, the same federal court found that the FCC did not have legal reasons to enforce those rules on services not considered common carriers. Just a year later, the FCC passed a net neutrality order. The same courts found this order to have legal reasons behind it. The telecommunication firms appealed to the supreme court. This case was denied in 2018. However, in 2017, the leadership of the FCC was replaced, and the new leader threw out those rules. Currently, the FCC rulings have passed the problems of enforcing the various rules to the FTC. However, the FTC can not make new rules, only enforce them.

## Proponents

Proponents suggest that net neutrality is important because it preserves free speech by prohibiting ISPs from blocking content, it prevents ISPs from discriminating against certain content, and it provides an equal playing field for new companies.

Many movements use social media platforms to coordinate and make their voices heard. Without net neutrality, ISPs could block movements that support ideas that could be detrimental to their own interests, whether social or political. Proponents thus support net neutrality on the basis of the internet's being a public avenue of speech, in which censorship would violate free speech.

Secondly, net neutrality prevents ISPs from slowing down, speeding up, or charging higher fees for certain content. Without net neutrality, companies could charge extra fees for using services not provided by the ISP, thereby removing an element of free choice from the internet. The additional charges could limit access to platforms promoting certain ideals and thus reduce the ability of someone's voice to be heard.

Finally, net neutrality promotes competition by providing an equal playing field for new companies. Without the level playing field that net neutrality provides, large companies could block other companies from achieving any sort of user base. As a result of their monopoly on their area of platforms, they could discriminate against content detrimental to their own interests.

## Opponents

Opponents suggest net neutrality is unnecessary because the internet developed mostly without it, it creates burdensome regulation to govern the internet, and it reduces investment in internet services.

Many large internet-based companies were started and became successful without net neutrality regulations. For example, Google was founded in 1998, and it has become one of the largest companies in the world. Many of those companies are beneficial to America. As a result, opponents argue that net neutrality is unneeded because many positive outcomes came from the period before net neutrality.

In 2017, the FCC claimed that net neutrality rules imposed significant and "unnecessary" reporting burdens on ISPs to prove compliance. For example, CenturyLink estimated the extra cost of net neutrality rules was about 5,000 hours of paperwork, which cost about $134,000 each year. The CTIA Wireless Foundation claims that the FCC fails to distinguish between large and small companies providing broadband, thus failing to reduce burdens on the smaller companies.

Net neutrality rules reduce investment in the internet. As a result of the rules, many companies are unwilling to invest in advanced systems because they are afraid the various rules might not allow them to offer their services to the free market. Additionally, they believe that net neutrality rules stifle new competition that might offer special services for important traffic or give other benefits.
