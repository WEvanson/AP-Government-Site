# Net Neutrality

Net neutrality is the concept that internet service providers (ISPs) should provide access to all content on the internet regardless of the source without favoring or blocking particular sources, products, or websites.

## Proponents

Proponents suggest that net nuetrality is important because it preserves free speech by prohibiting ISPs from blocking content, it prevents ISPs from discrimanating against certain content, and it provides an equal playing field for new companies.

Many movements use social media platforms to coordinate and make their voices heard. Without without net neutrality, ISPs could block movements which support ideas which could be determintal to their own interests, whether social or political. Proponents thus support net neutrality on the basis of the internet being a public avenue of speech, of which censorship would violate free speech.

Secondly, net neutrality prevents ISPs from slowing down, speeding up, or charging higher fees for certain content. Without net neutrality, companies could charge extra fees for using services not provided by the ISP, thereby removing an element of free choice from the internet. The additional charges could limit access to platforms promoting certain ideals, and thus reduce the ability for someone's voice to be heard.

Finally, net neutrality promotes competition by providing an equal field for new companies. Without the level playing field net neutrality provides, large companies could block other companies from acheiving any sort of user base. As a result of the monopoly on their area of platforms, they could, discrimate against content determintal to their own interests.
